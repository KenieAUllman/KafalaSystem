# KafalaSystem
This project is a base exploration of the populations that have moved into countries who have implemented a Kafala System. This is a work sponsorship wherein
employers have a lot of control over the activities of their employees from other countries. I am not currently done with this project. Things I still wish to 
review here: 
1. More information on how many people have immigrated to each of these countries
2. How many have been offered work visa under this system 
3. What policies have already been implmented to regulate this process 
4. Where the victims of this system originated 
5. What policy changes could be implemented to assist in this process. 

This is the beginnings of a large exploratory project, follow me if you would like to get updates on my research.
